      its('name') { should eq 'organizations/1234'  }
      its('display_name') { should eq 'google.com' }
    end

    describe google_organization(name: 'organizations/1234') do
      it { should exist }
      its('name') { should eq 'google.com'  }
      its('lifecycle_state') { should eq 'ACTIVE' }
    end
